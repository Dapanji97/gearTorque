# gearTorque
  Often during my mechanic work I find my self modifying transmissions and differentials in a trial-and-error fashion. Installing and uninstalling this components is arduous and time consuming. This line of work pays per job regardless of the time invested into the project. Therefore, trial-and-error wasn't the best approach. 
Calculation prior to power train modification proved useful and time efficient yet repetitive. Later on, given the repetitive nature, scripting with Perl speed up
the process even more! One could be all set with this approach, though not every technician codes, nor even consider coding. So here it is, gearTorque.
  The aproach shall be a simple and minimalist one. We want user to go through current torque outputs and analyze all posible scenarios within minutes. This so he/she can focus on the technical work. To achieve more with the time saved, to demand less from ones physical body, and essentially make a better living.
  Aims for this program:
    -Torque output calculation and evaluation of other posible scenarios with different gearing.
    -Calculation of posible max speeds with each gear, perhaps develop a graph to show this.
    -Calculation of fuel or electric power efficientcy and mile range.
    -Estimation of power output and overall performance under racing.
    -Ability to create and save a vehicles profile with it's history of work and performance.
  Some usefull variables might be:
    -Curb weight.
    -Type of drive train (rear-wheel, all-wheel, front-wheel drive)
    -Wheel size.
    -Drive train layout (FF, FR, MR, RR).
    -Aerodynamics.
  
  If someone ever reads this, hope you find this program useful, happy tunning!
